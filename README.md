   Installation
   Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tomatodiseasedetection.git

   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
UsagePrepare Dataset:
Ensure you have a dataset of tomato fruit images categorized by disease type. The dataset should be organized in subdirectories, each named after the corresponding disease.Train the Model:
To train the model, run:shCopy codepython train.py
Evaluate the Model:
To evaluate the trained model, run:shCopy codepython evaluate.py
Detect Diseases:
To use the model for detecting diseases in new images, run:shCopy codepython detect.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
Model ArchitectureThe ensemble model consists of several pre-trained CNNs, such as:VGG16ResNet50InceptionV3These models are fine-tuned on the tomato fruit disease dataset and combined to form an ensemble for improved performance.DatasetThe dataset used for this project should contain labeled images of tomato fruits affected by various diseases. Each category should represent a specific disease.TrainingThe training process involves:Loading and preprocessing the dataset.Fine-tuning pre-trained models using transfer learning.Combining the models into an ensemble.Training the ensemble model on the dataset.EvaluationThe model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also generated for detailed analysis.ResultsThe ensemble model achieves high accuracy in detecting tomato fruit diseases, outperforming individual models. Detailed results and performance metrics are provided in the results directory.ContributingContributions are welcome!
